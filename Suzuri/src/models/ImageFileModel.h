// A read-only image buffer. Like PdfFileModel, it inherits every read-only
// default from the base (isModified / isUserEditable false, undo inert,
// reloadContent -> setData) and implements only data() / setData().
//
// Holds three things:
//
//   data_   — the file's bytes, RETAINED. data() stays truthful, so the
//             Vault's external-change no-op check (disk == data()) still
//             works; an animated image needs a live QIODevice over them for
//             its QMovie; and it costs only the compressed size. No base
//             shared with PdfFileModel: what the two have in common is one
//             member and a one-line getter.
//
//   pixmap_ — the decoded first frame, the shared resource every view shows —
//             the image analogue of PDF's one parse. QPixmap is implicitly
//             shared, so N views on one image (or a common-vault image in two
//             windows) hold one set of pixels; converting a QImage per view
//             would copy them per view. A null pixmap means the decode failed,
//             and views show their load-failure placeholder off isNull().
//
//   isAnimated_ — whether the content has more than one frame. Read from the
//             content, not the extension, so an animated WebP animates too
//             and a static GIF doesn't pay for a QMovie. The model never
//             plays anything: each view runs its own
//             QMovie over data() and pauses it while hidden (ImageFileView).
//             pixmap_ is still the first frame, shown until the movie starts
//             and whenever it isn't running.
//
// Decoding is by CONTENT: QImageReader sniffs the format, so the extension only
// dispatched us here (FileTypes). Auto-transform is on so EXIF orientation is
// applied — Qt leaves it off by default, and a browser (so Obsidian) applies
// it; without it, portrait phone photos open sideways. A multi-page TIFF shows
// its first page. Qt's default decode allocation limit (256 MB) stands: past
// it, the read fails and the view shows the placeholder.
//
// QPixmap needs the GUI application, so this model is GUI-bound in the way
// PdfFileModel (QtPdf) already is; it's built on the GUI thread by the Vault
