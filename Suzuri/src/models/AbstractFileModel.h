// setData(); on flush it reads data() and writes.
//
// Polymorphic by file type: text, PDF, image. Views, tabs, and the Vault's map

    // Undo state is model-owned, not view-owned: the single stack lives on the
    // buffer (for text, TextFileModel's PrimeDocument) and is shared across
    // every view of the file, so undo in one view reverses the same edit
    // everywhere rather than drifting per view. The window's Undo/Redo actions
    // dispatch here on whichever model backs the active view
    // (BaseWindow::activeFileModel). That is why these live on the base and not
    // on any view: two views of one file share one undo, not one each — a view
    // forwarder would site a shared concept on the wrong object.
    //
    // The defaults are inert, so the non-editable types (image/PDF) inherit a
    // no-op undo and permanently-unavailable state with zero code. An editable
    // type overrides the four and emits the two availability signals below —
    // text does. undo()/redo() no-op safely when the stack is empty, so callers
    // need not pre-check availability

    // --- Views / eviction ----------------------------------------

    // Count the views borrowing this model, so the Vault can evict the buffer
    // once the last one closes. This lives on the base — not on TextFileModel's
    // PrimeDocument — because every file type has views but only text has a
    // prime: image/PDF models reuse this untouched. Kept GUI-free by taking a
    // QObject* the model only connects to and never dereferences, so no view
    // header leaks into the model layer.
    //
    // The model observes each view's destroyed rather than views calling back
    // on teardown, so a view dying first can never touch a dead model. Called
    // exactly once per view, from the AbstractFileView base constructor, so the
    // count needs no membership set — one call in, one destroyed out

    // --- External-change notifications ----------------------

    // The Vault owns IO, so it decides what happened on disk and makes these
    // calls; keeping the emits here leaves each signal owned by the model that
    // declares it. Views borrowing this model react, and because a shared
    // common-vault file has ONE model, every window's views react together —
    // pop-outs included.

    // The file vanished from disk while open — deleted or moved. Views
    // self-close: the buffer they showed no longer has a home on disk (no
    // off-disk buffers). The Vault frees the model right after
    void notifyRemovedFromDisk() { emit removedFromDisk(); }

    // The buffer was replaced from disk after an external change. Text views
    // need nothing here — the prime already routed the new content into their
