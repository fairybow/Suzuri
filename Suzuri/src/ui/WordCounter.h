// The status bar's word counter: the words, characters, and lines of the
// window's active text view, as "1,234 words · 5,678 characters". With a
// selection each count reads "12 of 1,234 words" — the selection's count
// against the document's — as Word and Google Docs show it. What counts as a
// word or a character is TextCounts' business; a line is a hard line (a
// QTextBlock), as it is for CursorPosition.
//
// Shown only while it has an editor to read, exactly as CursorPosition: the
// window hands it one for a text view and nullptr otherwise, and with nullptr
// it hides. It also hides when switched off in the vault's settings, or when
// every count is — and counts nothing it isn't showing.
//
// The document's counts are kept and recounted in full a moment after the text
// stops changing (RECOUNT_DEBOUNCE_MS_), by walking its blocks — no copy of the
// whole text is made. That's a few milliseconds for a novel-length file and it
// only ever runs for the active view, so there is no manual-refresh mode for
// big documents. If a huge file ever makes the pause after typing felt, the
// next step is keeping each block's counts and recounting only edited blocks.
// The selection's counts aren't kept: they're recounted from the selected text
// on each selection change, which costs in proportion to the selection
