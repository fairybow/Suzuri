// A tab mark for a page: the small glyph its tab draws ahead of the title. It
// lives ON the page widget for the same reasons the pin does (PagePin): the
// page pointer is the identity that already rides through every move — it is
// the leaf's tabData payload, the drag payload, and the object a replace or a
// restore hands back — so the mark survives a reorder, a move to another leaf
// or a pop-out, and a workspace restore, with no addPage / takePage parameter
// and no DragState_ field.
//
// A dynamic property, rather than a typed member, keeps this decoupled from the
// two unrelated page types: AbstractFileView and NewTabPage share only QWidget.
// A TabPaneLeaf reads pageIcon to draw the tab exactly as it reads windowTitle
// for the tab text and isPagePinned for the button glyph, so it stays
// page-type-ignorant. The one stringly-typed key is centralized here.
//
// What a mark MEANS is the window's business, not the leaf's. VaultWindow sets
// one on a view whose file belongs to a vault other than the window's own — a
// Common Vault file open in a project window — and never in the Common Vault's
// own window, where the two vaults are one object. The leaf just draws whatever
// it finds, so a later use (per-file-type glyphs, say) needs nothing here.
//
// Set once, at view construction, and never updated: a file can't change vaults
// under a view (Vault::relocate_ keeps both ends inside one vault), and a tab
// dragged into another window's family is refused by familyId. So unlike the
// title, there is no change signal for the leaf to bind — the leaf applies the
// mark wherever a tab gains a page.
//
// The consolidation noted in PagePin would cover this too: a shared TabPage :
// QWidget base carrying pin, title, and mark as typed members would unite what
// currently hangs off QWidget in three places
