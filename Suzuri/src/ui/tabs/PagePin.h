// Pinned state for a tab page. It lives ON the page widget, not on the hosting
// tab, because the page pointer is the identity that already rides through
// every move: it is the leaf's tabData payload (so it survives an in-leaf
// reorder), it is the drag payload (so it survives a move to another leaf or a
// pop-out), and it is the same object a replace or a restore hands back.
// Storing the bit on that object means all of those carry it for free — no
// DragState_ field, no addPage / takePage parameter.
//
// A dynamic property, rather than a typed member, keeps this decoupled from the
// two unrelated page types: AbstractFileView and NewTabPage share only QWidget.
// A TabPaneLeaf reads isPagePinned() to render the pin indicator exactly as it
// reads windowTitle for the tab text, so it stays page-type-ignorant. The one
// stringly-typed key is centralized here.
//
// A possible consolidation (docs/TODO.md): a shared TabPage : QWidget base
// carrying pin state and title as typed members, uniting what currently hangs
// off QWidget in two places. It trades a qobject_cast in the leaf for that
// consolidation
