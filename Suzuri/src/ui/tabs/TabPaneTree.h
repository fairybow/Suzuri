// The split tree. A QWidget owning a *replaceable* root QSplitter — NOT a
// QSplitter itself. Splitting the root against its orientation wraps it in a
// new splitter; owning the root internally lets it be swapped without churning
// the window's central widget or invalidating the window's pointer to the tree.
//
// Structure: nested QSplitters are branches, TabPaneLeafs are leaves. A leaf
// holds N tabbed pages; the tree holds N leaves. Both window types host one.
//
// Invariant: the tree always contains at least one leaf. Collapsing the last
// occupied leaf leaves an empty leaf as the floor (its underlay shows), never
// an empty tree.
//
// Drag & drop is QDrag-lite: QDrag gives us cross-window drop routing for free,
// but the MIME carries only a marker — the moved page and its origin are read
// from the source tree via QDropEvent::source(), never serialized. The page
// moves only on a committed drop, so the source never sits empty mid-drag and
// the collapse rule needs no suppression. An invalid drop (no family target)
// pops the page out into a new window in the same vault family.
