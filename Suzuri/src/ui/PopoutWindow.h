    // focused pop-out, and it reaches App directly rather than being relayed
    // through the owning VaultWindow.

    // in the Vault, so the one flush in VaultWindow::closeEvent covers the
    // files open here too. Closing a pop-out on its own saves nothing and loses
    // nothing — the buffer stays in the Vault, whether or not it's open
