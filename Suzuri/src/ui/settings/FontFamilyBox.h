// A font family picker. The list runs, separated into groups:
//
//   [missing]  the current family, when this machine doesn't have it
//   default    the default text font (VaultConfig), bundled
//   bundled    the other fonts Suzuri ships (BundledFonts)
//   system     every other family the font database knows
//
// Bundled families are registered with the application's font database, so
// they're in its family list too; they're dropped from the system group so
// none appears twice. Private families (macOS's dot-prefixed system fonts,
// which aren't meant to be picked) are dropped as well.
//
// Families aren't filtered by name: dropping those that end in Bold, Light,
// Black, and the like would also drop real families ("Arial Black"). And a
// family that isn't installed here is shown rather than hidden. A vault can
// arrive from another machine naming a font this one lacks: Qt falls back to
// another font to draw it, but the setting still names the original, and a box
// showing the default instead would misstate it. The missing entry is labeled
// as such and stays in the list, so the user can switch away and back.
//
// Each item's data is the family name, and the label may differ (the missing
// entry's does). The owner reads family() — never currentText() — on
// currentIndexChanged. Items are drawn in the UI font; a preview of each
// family in its own face is a possible later addition
