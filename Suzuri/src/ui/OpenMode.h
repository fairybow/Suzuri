// VaultFileTree — and creating a new file — opens with ReplaceActive: the file
// takes over the active tab, Obsidian-style, unless that tab is pinned, in
// which case it lands in a new one. The file context menu's items each name
// their own placement instead: NewTab always adds a tab to the active leaf;
// SplitRight splits the active leaf to the right and opens there; NewWindow
// opens in a fresh pop-out. None of those three ever replace the active tab
