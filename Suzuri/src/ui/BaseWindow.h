// The shared base for both window types. Owns the TabPaneTree and window-wide
// chrome; subclasses arrange the tree into their central widget — PopoutWindow
// sets it directly, VaultWindow puts it beside the Sidebar.
//
// Also home to the per-window action registry. The registry itself is PRIVATE,
// so a subclass cannot file an action behind its back; there are exactly three
// ways in and one way out:
//
//   registerAction(id, text, shortcut)      — mint, window-add, file
//   registerAction(id, text, StandardKey)   — same, platform bindings
//   adoptAction(id, action)                 — window-add and file an action
//                                             this window did not create
//   action(id)                              — read, asserting on a miss
//
// Every registered action is added to the window, so its shortcut fires
// whenever the window is active, independent of any menu's visibility. Menus
// (VaultWindow only) are display surfaces that addAction the pointers; a
// PopoutWindow has no menu and relies on the same actions purely for their
// shortcuts.
//
// Two sources fill the registry. The window MINTS what only it can perform:
// document.undo / document.redo dispatch through this window's own active view
// (below), so each window needs its own. It ADOPTS what App performs — every
// pointer in AppActions — since those must behave identically from any window
// and App connects them once at mint.
//
// Ids name the thing acted on, never the menu the action currently sits in — a
// menu can move, and these strings are user-visible in a future command palette
// and persisted in the hotkey config. "document." is the buffer, not the tab or
// the editor widget: undo routes through the model's shared prime, so it
// reverses in every view of that file, in every window.
//
// And home to the status bar, so both window types have one. Its items report
// on this window's active page (TabPaneTree::activePageChanged) when that page
// is a text view, and hide when it isn't — over a PDF, an image, a New Tab
// page, or an empty pane the bar stays up, empty. It doesn't come and go with
// the page type, which would change the height of everything above it on
// each tab switch
