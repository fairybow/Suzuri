namespace Suzuri {

// One row of the vaults list. A plain value, like FileRef: nobody owns it, and
// App builds a fresh QList<VaultEntry> on demand from AppConfig's recents,
// handing it to the two surfaces that render the list — ManageVaults' recents
// column and each window's VaultSwitcher menu.
//
// Built, not stored. Only `root` is persisted (in AppConfig's recentVaults);
// `name`, `missing`, and `open` are all derived by App when it assembles the
// list, so the surfaces don't each re-derive them. `root` is the open target: a
// chosen entry lands on App::onOpenOrMakeVaultRequested_, exactly like the
// picker's own buttons.
//
// `open` is the one derived field that reads in-memory state rather than the
// disk: it's true when a window currently holds this vault (openVaults_).
// ManageVaults gates on it — a row's rename and remove-from-list are disabled
// while that vault is open — so keeping it on the entry puts the open-vault
// knowledge in one place. It's fresh per build and the surfaces rebuild on
// vaultsChanged (which fires on close as well as open), so it never goes stale
// under a live picker.
//
// `isCommon` marks the one row that IS the Common Vault. Derived by App for the
// same reason as the rest: App is the only object that holds commonVault_, so
// it is the only one that can answer by the pointer's own root rather than by a
// path a surface was separately handed. ManageVaults uses it to omit the rename
// and remove-from-list items entirely — not grey them: those two are gated on a
// CONDITION for a project vault (close it, restore the folder), and the Common
// Vault has no such condition. Its folder is resolved at launch from AppConfig,
// not from this list, and its Vault is live and windowless, so a rename would
// strand it on a dead root. VaultSwitcher already drops the Common Vault from
// its menu by root comparison and needs nothing here.
//
// No id field. A vault is its path, and the list resolves entirely by it — name
// from the folder, missing from exists(), open by path, open-target the path.
