// The stable ids every action is filed under in a window's registry. Named
// constants rather than loose literals because a mistyped id is otherwise a
// silent runtime gap — BaseWindow::action asserts on a miss, but only in a
// debug build; here the compiler catches it either way.
//
// THE NAMING RULE: the prefix names the thing acted on, never the menu the
// action currently sits in. A menu can move — a View-menu item becoming a
// Window-menu item shouldn't invalidate a persisted hotkey or a palette entry —
// and these strings are exactly what gets persisted in the hotkey config and
// shown in a future command palette. So:
//
//   document.   the buffer. Undo routes through the model's shared prime, so
//               it reverses in every view of that file, in every window —
//               it is not "the active tab's undo" and must not be named as
//               though it were
//   file.       a file on disk in the vault
//   folder.     a directory in the vault
//   window.     one window's own chrome
//   view.       one view's presentation, per-view and not the buffer: zoom is
//               view-local (two views of one PDF zoom independently), so it
//               is named for the view, not document. Like document., a menu can
//               move it without invalidating a persisted hotkey
//   vault.      the vault as a whole, beyond any one file or folder in it — its
//               settings. Per-window like file., since each window edits its
//               own vault
//   app.        App owns the behaviour and windows only display it — the
//               AppActions set. This prefix doubles as the marker for what
//               travels down from App rather than being minted per window
//
// QString rather than the constexpr auto used in CoreConstants: these are
// QHash<QString, QAction*> keys, hit at every menu build and every future
// palette lookup, and a char/QLatin1 constant would convert on each one.
// QString has no dependency on QCoreApplication, so namespace-scope static
// initialization is safe
