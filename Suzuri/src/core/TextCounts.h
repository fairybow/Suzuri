// The words in text, as a writer counts them. One pass, nothing allocated.

// A word is a run of letters and digits (with their accents). A few
// characters stay inside a word when they sit BETWEEN two of its characters —
// apostrophes, hyphens, and the period — and a comma does between two digits.
// So "don't", "well-known", "e.g." and "1,000" are one word each. Everything
// else separates: whitespace, dashes, slashes, an ellipsis, and two joiners
// in a row ("word--word", "wait...what"). Only letters and digits make a word,
// so Markdown and Fountain marks never count: "# Heading" is one word,
// "**bold**" is one, and a lone "-" or "—" is none.
//
// Splitting on whitespace alone counts those marks as words and reads
// "word—word" as one. Unicode's own word boundaries (QTextBoundaryFinder::Word)
// read "well-known" as two, which no word processor does.
//
// Chinese characters and Japanese kana are one word EACH, since those scripts
// put no spaces between words — Obsidian's rule. Korean uses spaces and
// counts as runs. Known limit: Thai, Lao, Khmer and Myanmar also write
// without spaces and have no such rule here, so they undercount
