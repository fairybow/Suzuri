// never rewritten behind their back. The write also makes the folder
// (Io::write, CreateDirs::Yes), so "the folder is absent" IS "this is initial
// creation" — no separate first-run flag needed. A .suzuri/ deleted while the
// vault is open is recreated at the next workspace save, as Obsidian does with
// .obsidian.
//
// It never creates the vault root itself. Every open path has already checked
// the root exists, so a missing root here means the vault folder was deleted or
// moved outside Suzuri mid-session — and reading .suzuri/'s absence as "new
// vault" would recreate the root, leaving a ghost folder where the vault was.
// Returns whether .suzuri/ exists afterward, so a caller about to write into it
// (WorkspaceFile) can skip instead
