// One view of one file. A QWidget base so file types are handled
// polymorphically (text, PDF, image), which is why TextFileView holds a
// QPlainTextEdit as a child rather than subclassing it.
//
// Construction: the derived constructor builds its own content widget and hands
// it to setWidget(). A derived ctor body runs after the base is fully
// constructed, so there's no dispatch-to-base problem and no second-phase call
// to forget.
//
// Borrows its model from the Vault; never owns it. Holds no FileRef of its own
// — model()->fileRef() is the single source.
//
// Built parentless: every view is made by VaultWindow::makeView_ and handed to
// a TabPaneLeaf, whose page stack parents it on add. So there is no parent
// parameter at all — it would only ever be nullptr (house rule: no default
// args for arguments that are never passed).
//
// Load failure. A view whose file couldn't be loaded — a corrupt or locked PDF,
// an image Qt can't decode (a damaged file, or a missing TIFF/WebP imageformats
// plugin) — swaps its content widget for a centered message via showLoadFailure
// / showLoadedContent. Lives here rather than in each view because PDF and
// image share it exactly; text never calls it and pays nothing (the label is
// created on first failure). Both widgets sit in the base's layout and one is
// hidden — a hidden widget takes no space, so no QStackedWidget is needed
