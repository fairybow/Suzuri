# TODO

Bugs and code chores. Features that aren't built yet are in [Future.md](Future.md); conventions are in [CodeStyle.md](CodeStyle.md).

## Bugs

- [ ] When a tab drag is dropped, activate and focus the tab's widget
- [ ] VaultSwitcher's menu should open upward
- [ ] Focus the current tab's widget on restore (something probably keeps the focus from working, because it's surely already called)
- [ ] After restore, the first click on a tab doesn't focus its widget. Later clicks do
- [ ] "Go to file" on a new tab in a pop-out used to activate the main window and never return focus to the pop-out. Likely fixed now that the switcher opens over the page's own window: verify
- [ ] Pop-out Z-order isn't restored: a pop-out that was in front of its vault window comes back behind it. Vault windows restore in the right order among themselves, so this may be pop-outs only, and may not be fixable (which would be fine)
- [ ] Opening the file that is already in the active, unpinned tab should do nothing
- [ ] Minor: dragging a file quickly from near its row's bottom edge moves the selection band (grey, blue left edge) down to the next row, though that row isn't selected
- [ ] The "Options" heading in the settings dialog can be hovered or selected and probably shouldn't be
- [x] The text editor's context menu opened to the left of the pointer, by the width of the line-number gutter and the margin. Qt gives a scroll area's menu position in its viewport's coordinates, and it was mapped from the editor's
- [x] A path with a `..` segment passed `Vault::contains`, so a rename or move could take an entry out of the vault, and `Vault::openModel` opened a `../` or absolute path from a hand-edited `workspace.json`. `Vault` now takes only plain paths (see "Identity" in [Architecture.md](Architecture.md))

## Rough edges

- [ ] Tabs can be dragged past the left or right end of the tab bar without starting a drag; may want to clamp them
- [ ] No auto-scroll while dragging a tab in an overflowing bar (close to impossible with Qt)
- [ ] Under the "C" locale (a Linux session with no locale set), the file tree doesn't read a number in a name as a number: "chapter 10" sorts before "chapter 2"
- [ ] A vault whose root path is not plain (a trailing separator, a `.` or `..` segment) contains nothing by `Vault::contains`, so every create, rename, move, and delete in it is refused. The folder picker and the known-vaults list give plain paths; a root from the command line will need cleaning first
- [ ] In a release build, `PrimeDocument` notices a view document out of step with the prime only when their lengths differ. An edit applied at the wrong position keeps the lengths equal and goes unnoticed until they diverge. A full comparison when a save reads the text would catch it before it reaches disk
- [ ] When `PrimeDocument` resets a view that was out of step, that view's cursor goes to the start of the file
- [ ] A pane whose files were all deleted between sessions is restored as an empty pane inside a split, where in use a pane closes with its last tab. `TabPaneTree::restore` builds the saved shape and prunes nothing. A split left with one child (by this, or by a hand-edited `workspace.json`) is kept the same way
- [ ] On Windows, deleting a folder that a tree has listed, from outside Suzuri, logs Qt's "FindNextChangeNotification failed ... (Access is denied.)" once per watched folder. Harmless: the rows still go
- [ ] The spelling language in `settings.json` is used as a file name without being checked, so a hand-edited `../x` names a dictionary outside the dictionaries folder. `SpellCheckers` should take only a single name, as `Vault` takes only plain paths
- [ ] When `Vault::addToDictionary` can't write `dictionary.txt`, the failure is only logged: the word is accepted until the vault closes and is gone the next time it opens, with nothing shown
- [ ] A bundled dictionary is copied to the dictionaries folder once and never replaced, so a newer one in a later release doesn't reach an existing install
- [ ] If a file reloads from disk while the editor's context menu is open, a suggestion chosen afterward is inserted wherever the word's cursor ended up, not over the word
- [ ] A web address or a file path is spellchecked piece by piece, so "github" and "com" are marked
- [ ] Unverified: text in decomposed Unicode form (a letter followed by a separate combining accent) is probably marked as misspelled against a dictionary that stores the single-character form. If so, normalize a word before it is checked

## Before release

- [x] `LogView` opens on every launch, for testing. Put it behind its command-line flag
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md` has only a placeholder release entry. Write the real notes before tagging
- [ ] Test the OS logout save path (`App::onCommitDataRequest_`)
- [ ] Need the remaining Edit menu and text editor context menu options (cut, copy, past, select all, delete)
- [ ] A licenses dialog crediting what Suzuri bundles: Hunspell, the en_US dictionary (`resources/dictionaries/README_en_US.txt` carries its terms), the fonts, and Lucide

## Code

- [ ] Verify the `PrimeDocument` header, and rename it
- [ ] Rename `BaseWindow`'s protected members that have a trailing underscore
- [ ] Bring `MenuBuilder` over from Hearth (maybe into Coco)?
- [x] Decide on `private slots:`. It isn't used consistently, and using it properly would break up sections that are organized by purpose. Either remove the keyword everywhere or sort slots into it everywhere
- [ ] `AbstractFileModel` has `notifyX()` functions that only emit a signal. Could they just be signals (perhaps named `notify...`)?
- [ ] Decide whether static helpers go before other functions, per access level
- [ ] A shared `TabPage` base for tab pages, holding title and pin state as typed members in place of the window title and a dynamic property. It would trade the leaf's property reads for a cast. Worth doing once a third such value appears
- [x] Run the tests on every push, for Suzuri and for Coco's smoke test. `release.yml` runs only on a version tag, and now builds the tests too: pass `-DAPP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF` there
- [ ] `AbstractFileView` has `setSpellChecker` and `setAcceptedWords`, which only `TextFileView` implements, and `VaultWindow::makeView_` already holds the `TextFileView` when it makes one. Wiring spelling there would take both off the base, and `hunspell.hxx` out of every view's includes
- [ ] CI has no Windows job. Qt 6.11 installs on Windows only through the official installer, which needs a Qt account (see `release.yml`). Add the job once the open-source installer handles it

## Untested

What the tests in `Suzuri/tests/` don't reach.

- [ ] A failed write: the buffer stays modified, and `Vault::flush` names the file. There is no portable way to make a write fail on demand
- [ ] The autosave debounce starting again on each edit. Proving it needs timing tight enough to fail on a slow machine
- [ ] A successful `Vault::moveToTrash`. It would put a file in the real system trash on every run
- [ ] `Vault::recreateRoot`
- [ ] A file that starts with two byte-order marks. On Qt 6.4 one is dropped on load, which the comment on the mark in `TextFileModel.h` says can't happen. Check it on the Qt in use
- [ ] `AppConfig`, `JsonIo`, `WorkspaceFile`, and everything in `views/` (apart from `TextSearch`) and `ui/`. The find bar and the way `TextFileView` drives a search are among them, as are the misspelling underlines and the spelling items in the editor's context menu. Considered for `TabPaneTree`'s save and restore and left out: a mistake there costs a layout, not text, and shows on the next launch

## Audits

Passes over the whole codebase against [CodeStyle.md](CodeStyle.md).

- [ ] Signals passed up parent chains
- [ ] Signals that only ever drive one slot in the same class
- [ ] Consistent terms: what is a pane, a leaf, a view, a page
- [ ] Naming and casing of types, functions, and members, including trailing underscores on private members
- [ ] Parent parameters not named for their parent type
- [ ] Widgets that start without a parent and are inserted into one later: name the parameter to say so
- [ ] Constructor work outside `setup_`
- [ ] `const`, `[[nodiscard]]`, `[[maybe_unused]]`
- [ ] `QDir` where a `Coco::Path` function would do
- [ ] Paths held or passed as `QString`
- [ ] Unneeded `Coco::Path(...)` conversions
- [ ] Includes not using the full path from `src/`
- [ ] Blank lines inside namespace braces
- [ ] Public functions nothing outside the class calls
- [ ] Order of sections within classes
- [ ] Helper classes used in one header that could move to its `Internal` namespace (`ZoomButton` in `ZoomControl.h`, for example)
- [ ] `TODO` comments in the source
