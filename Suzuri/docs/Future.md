# Future

What Suzuri doesn't do yet, might do, and won't do. For what it does today, see [Features.md](Features.md). Bugs and code chores are in [TODO.md](TODO.md).

Nothing here is a promise or a schedule.

- **Planned**: intended, not yet built
- **Maybe**: worth recording, and may never be built. Each entry says what would justify it
- **Not planned**: decided against, with the reason, so the question isn't reopened without new information
- **Open questions**: undecided

## Planned

### Go to File

- Recently opened files for an empty query, in place of the full alphabetical list. Obsidian does this, and it is what makes switching between two files quick (open, Down, Enter). Needs a per-vault record of recent files
- Create a file from the switcher: Enter with no match creates a file with the typed name. Needs a default extension and a ruling on folders in the typed text (`drafts/Chapter 2`)
- Fuzzy matching

### Command palette and hotkeys

- A command palette over the actions each window already registers. Every action has a stable id named for the thing it acts on, so the palette is a list and a filter with no changes to the actions themselves
- Rebindable hotkeys, saved per vault in `.suzuri/hotkeys.json`. An override has to carry a list of key sequences, since standard shortcuts expand to more than one (Redo is Ctrl+Y and Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- One header holding every default shortcut, with per-platform variation where a binding differs. The editor's own handling of the undo and redo keys, and its context menu's labels, would read from it too

### Editing

- Find and replace
- Spellcheck
- Hearth's typing helpers: auto-closing pairs, delete-pair, skip-closer, and barging past closing punctuation

### Files and file trees

- Delete key in the file tree
- Selecting and dragging several entries at once
- A command or menu route to move a file ("Move file to..."), so dragging isn't the only way
- Delete or rename the current file from its tab
- After New file or New folder inside a collapsed folder, expand the folder and select the new entry
- A "Don't ask again" option on the delete confirmation
- Show the operating system's own reason when the trash refuses an entry
- Name checks beyond forbidden characters: names differing only by case, Unicode normalization, and length limits

### Tabs, panes, and windows

- Drop a tab at the position it is dropped, not at the end of the bar
- A toggle to show or hide the sidebar, remembered per vault
- Remember whether the menu bar is shown
- Grey out Undo and Redo when there is nothing to undo or redo
- Shortcuts for splitting a pane
- On macOS, replace the menu bar toggle: the system owns the menu bar there, and Cmd+M is Minimize

### Appearance

- Themes, for the window and for the editor, saved in `.suzuri/appearance.json`
- Icons and text that follow a light or dark switch made while Suzuri is running. A few are colored once and kept
- A reset button beside the font size slider
- Font previews in the font list
- Separate interface and monospace font settings
- Hearth's color bar

### Editor details

- Emphasize the current line's number; click a line number to select its line
- Place the cursor from a click in the margin
- Scroll while a selection handle is held past the top or bottom edge
- A handle for a selection end that is scrolled out of view

### PDFs and images

- SVG and AVIF images
- PDF zoom that holds the point under the pointer in place
- A password prompt for protected PDFs

### Saving and safety

- When a save fails and can't be retried (a drive gone for good), a window showing each unsaved file's text to copy out by hand. It needs no disk, so it works when every write fails
- A status indicator that shows a failed save when it happens, not only when the window is closed

### Settings

- Pick up edits made to the settings files by hand, or by a sync, while the vault is open
- A trash destination setting, and with it permanent delete

### Opening from outside Suzuri

- Open a file or a vault passed on the command line, in the most recently used window. This is what makes "Open with Suzuri" and dragging a file onto the app work. Wanted after beta

### Git

Committing a vault to a repository, for backup and history.

- The repository is found by walking up from the vault's folder, as Git does. One repository may hold several vaults, and a vault may have none
- Status and commit would therefore belong to the repository, not the vault. Otherwise a commit from one vault would silently include another's changes

### Translations

- Singular and plural forms for the word counter's text ("1 word", "2 words")

## Maybe

- **Moving the Common Vault.** Would let it live somewhere other than `Documents/Suzuri/Common Vault`. See "Moving a vault from inside Suzuri" below for why this is hard
- **Recovery copies of files that vanish.** When a file is deleted outside Suzuri while open, its tab closes and up to three seconds of typing can go with it. Before closing, Suzuri could write the text to a recovery folder off the vault's drive and say so once. Periodic snapshots kept outside the vault (Obsidian's File Recovery) are the larger version. Worth building if a real loss is reported
- **Refusing an outside change.** Outside changes are always adopted, undoably. A file could instead be held against them: during a merge, or when explicitly locked
- **Ignoring a format-only outside change.** When another program changes only a file's line endings or byte order mark, the reload adds an undo step that visibly changes nothing and moves every cursor. The reload could be skipped. Leaning toward leaving it alone
- **A trash folder inside the vault,** used when the system trash refuses. Its one real use is a vault on a network share, which has no system trash and so can't delete in-app at all
- **Watching a whole vault through one handle.** Would end the Windows limit where other programs can't rename a folder Suzuri has listed. It needs a separate implementation per platform. Worth building if that limit becomes a real complaint
- **Checking open files when Suzuri regains focus.** On some platforms a file whose folder was renamed outside Suzuri keeps its tab until typed into. A check on return would close it sooner
- **Dragging a file out to the desktop** as a shortcut that opens it in its vault
- **Detecting and converting older text encodings** (Windows-1252 and others), in place of the warning
- **An overwrite toggle on the Insert key,** per editor, with a status bar indicator
- **Drop zones that move.** While a tab is dragged over a pane's edge, the pane would shrink aside to show where the new pane will land
- **Highlights and bookmarks** kept beside a file, not in it
- **Grouping or nesting files** under one another in the tree
- **A corkboard**
- **Converting files from the command line** (text to PDF, for instance)
- **A confirmation before a folder becomes a vault.** Opening any folder as a vault silently adds `.suzuri/` to it; Obsidian asks first

## Not planned

- **Links, backlinks, and tags.** Suzuri is for plain text. Without links there is nothing to index and nothing to rewrite when a file is renamed
- **Unsaved documents and save prompts.** Every file is on disk and always saved. An untitled, in-memory document would bring back the prompts, the modified markers, and the recovery machinery this design removes
- **Moving a vault from inside Suzuri.** Built once, for the Common Vault, then removed. On Windows other programs (the folder picker, the shell, the indexer, antivirus) hold handles on the folders being moved, and the old folders can't be deleted while they do. Suzuri can't release handles it doesn't own. Moving the folder in a file manager and opening it again does the same job
- **Renaming the Common Vault.** Its location is fixed, and every window depends on it while Suzuri runs
- **Deleting a vault's folder from Manage Vaults.** It is someone's writing. "Remove from list" forgets the vault and leaves the folder alone
- **Showing unsupported file types.** Obsidian has a setting for this. Suzuri hides them: a file it can't open only adds noise to the tree
- **Readable line length.** The left/right margin setting does this job and leaves the width to the writer
- **An overwrite mode setting.** Overwrite is a typing mode, not a preference. Saved as a setting it would silently eat text
- **A conflict prompt when a file changes outside Suzuri.** Built once, then removed. With saves this frequent, an open file almost never differs from disk when an outside change arrives, and the reload can be undone
- **Go to File (Ctrl+O) in pop-out windows.** A pop-out's new tab page already offers it. A shortcut would need a copy of the action for every pop-out, which wasn't worth it
- **Renaming in place in the file tree** (F2). Rename uses a dialog, which checks the name as it is typed
- **File associations.** Suzuri doesn't register itself for any file type
- **Right-to-left layouts**

## Open questions

- **The word "vault".** The per-project container might become a Project or a Notebook, and the shared one simply the Vault
- **Autosave timing.** One second after typing stops and three seconds at most are working defaults, not settled numbers
- **Git: bundle a library or call the installed `git`?** Calling it adds no dependency but requires Git on the machine and makes errors harder to read
- **Sort order with hidden extensions.** Files sort by full name, so `a b.md` comes before `a.md` and the tree reads "a b", then "a". Whether to sort by the name shown is undecided
- **Markdown rendering.** Not ruled out, and probably not the way Obsidian does it. What form it would take is undecided: styling in place with the markup left visible, a separate read-only preview, or something else. Whatever it is, the file stays plain text and is written back unchanged
- **Folder links in the file tree.** The tree shows and expands symlinked folders; Go to File skips them. One of the two should change
